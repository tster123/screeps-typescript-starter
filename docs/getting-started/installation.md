# Installation

You will need:

 - Node.JS (Latest LTS is recommended)
 - A Package Manager (Yarn or NPM)

Download the latest source [here](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter/archive/v3.0.zip) and extract it to a folder.

Open the folder in your terminal and run `npm install` (or `yarn`) to install the dependencies.

Fire up your preferred editor with typescript installed and you are good to go!
